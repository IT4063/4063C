# Module 3 Lab: Snowflake + Python
You will learn how to connect to Snowflake and execute a query using python.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python installed
    * See [Downloading Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
* Access to Snowflake sandbox
    * See [module-2-snowflake-info](https://uc.instructure.com/courses/1666166/pages/module-2-snowflake-info?module_item_id=71810477)
*  Snowflake Connector for Python
     * You'll do this via the Python package installer 'pip' by running the following command

        ```
        pip install --upgrade snowflake-connector-python
    * See [Installing the Python Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-install)
* [4063C_24](https://github.com/IT4063/4063C_24) repo forked and cloned to your machine
    * See [Forking a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
    * See [Cloning a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
* Environment variables set
    * Run the following command to add your Snowflake User and Pass to your environment variables
      * See [How to Set Environment Variable in Windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/windows-set-environment-variable)
      * See [How to Set Environment Variable on Mac](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/set-environment-variable-mac)
        
        * MAC/LINUX
            ```
            export SNOWFLAKE_PASS='password'
            export SNOWFLAKE_USER='username'
            export SNOWFLAKE_ACCT='isa12503.east-us-2.azure'
        * PC
            ```
            set SNOWFLAKE_PASS=password
            set SNOWFLAKE_USER=username 
            set SNOWFLAKE_ACCT=isa12503.east-us-2.azure
    * OR See [Connecting to Snowflake with the Python Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-connect)
    * [NOTE: You can also use a connections.toml](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-connect#connecting-using-the-connections-toml-file)

## Option 1: Running python locally on your machine

### 1. Test the connection
Use test_connection.py to test the connection to snowflake
* Open up a terminal, change directories to your repo, and run the following command:

    ```
    python test_connection.py
### 2. Executing queries
Use the run_query.py script to query Snowflake
* Open run_query.py in the IDE of your choice
* Replace query variable value with the query you'd like to run
* Open up a terminal change directories to your repo, and run the following command:

    ```
    python run_query.py

### 3. Create a database
Create a new file, name it create_database.py, use it to create your own database
* Create create_database.py in the IDE of your choice
* Add the SQL statement needed to create a database - [HINT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-example#creating-a-database-schema-and-warehouse)
* Open up a terminal change directories to your repo, and run the following command: 
    ```
    python create_database.py
## Option 2: Running python in Snowflake
### 1. Login to Snowflake sandbox 
[Link to Sandbox](https://isa12503.east-us-2.azure.snowflakecomputing.com/console)
* Navigate to sandbox and login with your credentials. See Module 2: Snowflake Info for more details.

### 2. Open a python worksheet
[Link to Sandbox](https://isa12503.east-us-2.azure.snowflakecomputing.com/console)
* Sign in to Snowflake
* Open Worksheets
* Select + Â» Python Worksheet
* Select a database and schema (DATA_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC)
* Select Settings>Return type>'String'


### 3. Create a database using sample_snowflake_worksheet.py as a guide
* Open Worksheets
* paste code from sample_snowflake_worksheet.py
* alter code to [create a database](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-database)
* create a database, name it your snowflake username (e.g. 'burrelbn')


## Submission 
* Submit the name of the database you created in the assignment submission text box in Canvas.
* Post a link to your cloned repo
