* Access to Snowflake sandbox
    * See [Downloading Python](https://uc.instructure.com/courses/1666166/pages/module-2-snowflake-info?module_item_id=71810477)
*  Snowflake Connector for Python
     * You'll do this via the Python package installer 'pip' by running the following command

        ```
        pip install --upgrade snowflake-connector-python
    * See [Installing the Python Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-install)
* [4063C_24](https://github.com/IT4063/4063C_24) repo forked and cloned to your machine
    * See [Forking a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
    * See [Cloning a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
* Environment variables set
    * Run the following command to add your Snowflake User and Pass to your environment variables
        * MAC/LINUX
            ```
            export SNOWFLAKE_PASS='password'
            export SNOWFLAKE_USER='username'
            export SNOWFLAKE_ACCT='isa12503.east-us-2.azure'
        * PC
            ```
            set SNOWFLAKE_PASS=password
            set SNOWFLAKE_USER=username 
            set SNOWFLAKE_ACCT=isa12503.east-us-2.azure
    * See [Connecting to Snowflake with the Python Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-connect)


### 1. Test the connection
Use test_connection.py to test the connection to snowflake
* Open up a terminal, change directories to your repo, and run the following command:

    ```
    python test_connection.py
### 2. Executing queries
Use the run_query.py script to query Snowflake
* Open run_query.py in the IDE of your choice
* Replace query variable value with the query you'd like to run
* Open up a terminal, change directories to your repo, and run the following command:

    ```
    python run_query.py
### 3. Submit 
* copy the query id that was output from your script
* submit a link to your repo in Canvas>Module 3>Lab 1
