# Module 3 Lab: Snowflake + Python
You will learn how to connect to Snowflake and execute a query using python.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python installed
    * See [Downloading Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
* Access to Snowflake sandbox
    * See [Downloading Python](https://uc.instructure.com/courses/1666166/pages/module-2-snowflake-info?module_item_id=71810477)
*  Snowflake Connector for Python
     * You'll do this via the Python package installer 'pip' by running the following command

        ```
        pip install --upgrade snowflake-connector-python
    * See [Installing the Python Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-install)
* [Module 2](https://github.com/bjornburrell/Module2) repo cloned to your local machine
    * See [Cloning a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)



### Test the connection
Let's use the script, test_connection.py to test our connection to snowflake
* Open test_connection.py in the IDE of your choice
* Input your user name, password in the corresponding fields
    * Reach out if you need a login or are having trouble logging in
* Open up a terminal in the location where the file is saved, and run the following command:

    ```
    python test_connection.py
### Executing queries
Use the run_query.py script to query Snowflake
* Open run_query.py in the IDE of your choice
* Replace query variable value with the query you'd like to run
* Open up a terminal in the location where the file is saved, and run the following command:

    ```
    python run_query.py
